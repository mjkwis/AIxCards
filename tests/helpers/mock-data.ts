React Hooks are functions that let you use state and other React features without writing a class. 
They were introduced in React 16.8 to solve several problems with class components.

The most commonly used Hook is useState, which adds state to functional components. When you call useState, 
it returns a pair: the current state value and a function that lets you update it. You can call this function 
from an event handler or somewhere else.

useEffect is another essential Hook that lets you perform side effects in function components. It serves the 
same purpose as componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, and componentWillUnmount in React classes, but unified 
into a single API. By using this Hook, you tell React that your component needs to do something after render.

The dependency array in useEffect is crucial for performance optimization. If you pass an empty array, the 
effect will only run once after the initial render. If you pass specific values, the effect will only re-run 
when those values change. This prevents unnecessary executions of the effect.

useContext is a Hook that lets you subscribe to React context without introducing nesting. Context provides 
a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level. 
This is especially useful for themes, user authentication, or any global state.

Additional important Hooks include useReducer for complex state logic, useMemo for expensive calculations, 
and useCallback for memoizing callback functions. These optimization Hooks help prevent unnecessary re-renders 
and improve application performance.`.trim(),
